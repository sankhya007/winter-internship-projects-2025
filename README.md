## Project 2: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### 🏠 Advanced House Price Prediction System

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts California
housing prices using multiple regression algorithms with advanced
feature engineering and visualization.

### 📊 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for
predicting median house values in California districts. The system
includes advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, multiple
model comparison, and comprehensive visualization.

### 🚀 Features

-   Advanced Data Preprocessing: Automated missing value imputation and
    data validation
-   Feature Engineering: Created interaction features, location-based
    metrics, and categorical encoding
-   Multiple Algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random
    Forest
-   Model Comparison: Comprehensive evaluation with cross-validation
-   Advanced Visualizations: Interactive charts and business
    intelligence reports
-   Feature Importance: Detailed analysis of price drivers
-   Confidence Intervals: Prediction ranges with statistical confidence

### 🛠️ Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    Install dependencies:

    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Ensure you have the housing.csv dataset in the project root.

### 🎯 Usage

Run the main script:

    python linear_regression_model.py

The script will:

-   Load and validate the dataset
-   Perform advanced preprocessing and feature engineering
-   Train multiple machine learning models
-   Generate comprehensive visualizations
-   Provide business insights and predictions

### 📈 Model Performance

The system compares multiple algorithms:

-   Linear Regression: Baseline performance
-   Ridge Regression: Regularized linear model
-   Lasso Regression: Feature selection capabilities
-   Random Forest: Ensemble tree-based approach

### 🔍 Key Insights

-   Identifies top price-driving features
-   Provides confidence intervals for predictions
-   Generates strategic business recommendations
-   Visualizes model performance and data relationships

### 📊 Sample Predictions

The system includes pre-configured property profiles:

-   Luxury Coastal Villa: High-end properties
-   Family Suburban Home: Middle-income housing
-   Investment Opportunity: Value properties

### 🧪 Technical Details

Dataset: California Housing Prices (20,640 samples, 10 features)

Preprocessing: StandardScaler, VarianceThreshold, SimpleImputer

Validation: 80-20 train-test split, 3-fold cross-validation

Metrics: R² Score, MAE, RMSE, Cross-validation scores
