## Project 2: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### 🏠 Advanced House Price Prediction System

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts California
housing prices using multiple regression algorithms with advanced
feature engineering and visualization.

### 📊 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for
predicting median house values in California districts. The system
includes advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, multiple
model comparison, and comprehensive visualization.

### 🚀 Features

-   Advanced Data Preprocessing: Automated missing value imputation and
    data validation
-   Feature Engineering: Created interaction features, location-based
    metrics, and categorical encoding
-   Multiple Algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random
    Forest
-   Model Comparison: Comprehensive evaluation with cross-validation
-   Advanced Visualizations: Interactive charts and business
    intelligence reports
-   Feature Importance: Detailed analysis of price drivers
-   Confidence Intervals: Prediction ranges with statistical confidence
